    <h3>MASSIVE RAIN WORLD SPOILERS AHEAD, CLICK AWAY NOW IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE SPOILED</h3><br><br>
    <p>The Failed Ascensions AU takes place during Saint's campaign, after he has tried and failed to ascend many many times.<br>
    He meets Gourmand, Artificer, and Enot, who share a similar issue, but for different reasons.<br>Artificer is bound by violence, Enot by attraction, and Gourmand by happiness.<br>
    They do silly things together, like yelling at each other about what regions are called, coping with loss, visiting condemned biomechanical gods, learning that extreme violence is kinda bad, and other whacky adventures.<br>
      This AU was made because Rain World silly fluff is fun to write.<br>Also this disregards Enot's dating sim and stuff for the most part and is filled with my own headcanons.</p>

    <div class="title-bar-text">Set in stone ideas:</div>
  </div>
    <ul class="tree-view">
  <li>Gourmand met Enot (as a pup) and then Artificer, and then they all meet Saint</li>
  <li>Enot is Gourmand's son</li>
  <li>Saint has depression</li>
  <li>Important slugcats age order (from youngest to oldest) is Saint, Enot, Spearmaster, Gourmand and Artificer are the same age, Saint (mentally) due to metacyclic looping</li>
  <li>
    Enot was dating Spearmaster
    <ul>
      <li>Spearmaster eventually tried to ascend with Enot</li>
      <li>Spearmaster ascended</li>
      <li>Enot touched the void fluid and got partially echoed</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
    Gourmand tried to ascend after his whole colony ascended
    <ul>
      <li>Along with Enot, Gourmand got partially echoed and left behind</li>
      <li>Gourmand didn't really want to ascend, he wanted to be with his family</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <ul>Artificer tried to ascend, POST chieftan</ul> 
      <li>She managed to get through to the void sea, swim down, but got echoed and stuck</li>
      <li>So after that she decided to continue the cycle of violence</li>
      <li>She tried again after Pebbles collapsed, but failed again</li></ul>
